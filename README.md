# I) Practicing Visual Design  

Selected website : https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/
Main issue with this website : Alignment

If you were to continue, which principle would you choose next? Why? (1-3 sentences)

I will choose Contrast so we can differentiate the Links from one and another. The website feels dead to me, with no colours and default html and almost no css at all. To add more contrast, I could change the font size, the color of the brackground for every links and more. Try to change the weight of the font also could improve drastically the website, and add italics to the "Updated October 19, 2022" for example.
